                    <p>Israel refers to a variety of things, such as the literal descendants of the ancient Israelites, a geographical area, or those who are covenant keepers and followers of Jehovah/Christ regardless of lineage or location.</p>
                    <p>Scattering is an Old Testament concept that describes people forsaking God and covenants for idol worship, unfaithfulness to God, or political alliances not sanctioned by God. Prior to the Israelites final fall to the Babylonians, we see institutions such as idol worship, and even child sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>A very interesting thing we can learn from the Israelites subsequent to their exile in Babylon is how God instructs them to handle their captors. While some wanted to revolt, and others became loyal to the Babylonians, the faithful are told to live in a tension of subversion and loyalty. They are to serve Babylon, yet remain faithful to God. In this light, we can recognize Christ as the perfect example of subversive loyalty. He taught to love and bless your enemies, yet spoke out against the corrupt leaders in Jerusalem. We can learn a lot from thinking about how to live in the tension of our modern-day Babylon, and yet place God first.</p>
                    <p>While the twelve tribes of Israel were scattered and afflicted because of their unrighteousness and rebellion, the Lord also used this scattering of His chosen people among the nations of the world to bless those nations. This plays a large part in the Book of Mormon when the descendants of Lehi interact with the native people.</p>
                    <p>In these latter days - through the power of the Book of Mormon - a gathering of Israel is occuring. This entails both a spiritual bringing back and return to God and a physical coming back or return. Ultimately, the purpose is to offer covenants, fulfill covenants, and bless the lives of Godâ€™s children.</p>
