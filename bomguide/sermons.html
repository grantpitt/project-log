                    <p>In Moroni 7, we have a sermon that Mormon gave to the faithful Nephites. To begin his sermons, he tells us that to discern between good and evil, we need to make our judgements in light of Christ.</p>
                    <p>Next, he tells us that in order to lay hold of every good thing, we must have faith. He demystifies this concept for us and defines it as trust in God and his angelic messengers. Thus we have the choice to either believe His sources in this mortal life that is full of uncertainty, or look to the ever-changing guidelines of the world. Faith is thus a relationship with the past.</p>
                    <p>The pinnacle of the sermon is about having hope because of Christ. Hope - a relationship with the future - is thus always tied to Faith.</p>
                    <p>Finally, he speaks of charity, the pure love of Christ. He tells us that if we have faith and hope, yet lack charity, we are nothing.</p>
