                    <p>Intertextuality is the relationship between texts and thus a fundamental assumption of this method is that all texts are related. There is no such thing as an “original” text, rather “new” text is just building with bits and pieces of older texts.</p>
                    <p>As Julia Kristeva, author of ‘Desire in Language’ puts it, “Any text is constructed as a mosaic of quotations; any text is the absorption and transformation of another”.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, the strength of the intertextual relationships occurs at varying degrees. On one end, there is broad intertextuality in which entire works draw inspiration from another text. For example the Chronicles of Narnia have broad intentional intertextuality to the New Testament. On the other end, there exists limited intertextuality where we have references to phrases such as “Trojan Horse” or an “Achilles heel” rather than a connection between an entire theme.</p>
                    <p>In many ways, the intertextuality between the Book of Mormon and Bible is broad. The Bible is a story of how God deals with his covenant people; their successes and failures. The Book of Mormon is a second attempt to tell this story. While it can be read just fine on its own, it gains deeper meaning when read in conjunction with the Bible. The rich intertextuality between the Bible and Book of Mormon can can teach us about the interconnectedness of the scriptures and the commonalities between God's interactions with prophets.</p>
