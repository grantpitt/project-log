                    <p>Exegesis is the interpretation of a text that takes into account the context of its original author and/or editor. In other words, what meaning did the original author intend to convey to his or her audience?</p>
                    <p>In contrast, eisegesis is the interpretation of a scriptural text from a reader’s perspective. In other words, how does the reader interpret the text in order to apply it to his or her life?</p>
                    <p>Asking exegetical questions is important because when we read passages from the scriptures into our present situations, it’s possible that we come to conclusions that the author never intended. Not only is it important to understand who the author is and why they are writing, but to ask what the nature of the text is. For example, modern readers don’t read a novel in the same way that they read Shakespeare’s plays.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, engaging in eisegesis is also a very important tool for interpretation. Without eisegesis, scriptural texts become little more than ancient artifacts or history books filled with irrelevant facts and stories.</p>
                    <p>Both methods of interpretation are important if we are to accurately understand the words of the  prophets in the Book of Mormon as well as apply their teaching to our lives.</p>
