                    <p>An important question to ask when reading the scriptures is why so much of them are in story form? Why does God teach us through stories?</p>
                    <p>A few of the reasons we are taught by stories are that they help explain human action, articulate the structures of human consciousness, depict the identity of agents, account for the historical development of traditions, make meaning out of chaos, and display the content of Christian convictions.</p>
                    <p>These insights that come through stories are also why we see recurring themes such as deliverance from of bondage or destruction and the various patterns of condescension. </p>
                    <p>It's important to note that this concept of learning through scriptural stories is not brand new. Nephi and his family read the brass plates and knew the way God had delivered Moses and Israel out of bondage and certainly were able to relate with the idea of years in a wilderness. In fact, both the Nephites and Israelites had cultural narratives based on stories of Godâ€™s interactions with his people. Thus, we too can learn from drawing analogies to stories such as the Israelite exodus from Egypt or Lehi's Dream.</p>
